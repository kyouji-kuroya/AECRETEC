## Preamble

Creative works, knowledge, research outputs, and cultural materials are not mere consumables belonging to a single nation, corporation, or era. They are collective human memory and should be preserved for future generations.

Technology exists to protect and enable culture, not to subordinate culture to technology.

AECRETEC is a design philosophy for a distributed, inheritable approach to restoring the continuity of creative works and knowledge threatened by censorship, arbitrary deletion, and monopolistic control.

---

## Foundational Principles

### 1. Content-First

Identity of a work is defined by its content (the byte sequence / content identifier), not by presentation, labels, wrappers, or transmission method. Wrappers and labels are auxiliary and must not replace the authority of the content itself.

---

### 2. Balancing Censorship Resistance and Legal Compliance

AECRETEC does not centrally judge the moral or artistic quality of content. Operators (nodes) are responsible for compliance with the laws and regulations of their jurisdiction.

The protocol itself does not provide mechanisms for arbitrary centralized deletion or unjustified takedown.

---

### 3. True Ownership

Users must be able to use content without relying on proprietary clients, constant online connections, or closed DRM. Compatibility with standard formats and existing playback environments is a minimum requirement for true ownership.

If the environment requires proprietary or always-online mechanisms, the user has access only to temporary licenses or access, not true ownership.

---

### 4. Economic Incentives for Preservation

Cultural preservation must not rely solely on goodwill. Storage, distribution, and operation should be principally driven by economic incentives.

However, because of the public-good nature of many materials, the system does not exclude minimum free-storage quotas or public complement mechanisms for high-public-value content.

---

### 5. Transparency and Verifiability

Significant operations (issuance, distribution, rights assignment, re-wrapping) must be recorded in verifiable ways. Privileged or hidden operations are not allowed.

---

### 6. Non-monopolistic Multi-polarity

AECRETEC is not intended to be run, controlled, or owned exclusively by any single company, nation, or organization. Diverse implementations, multi-region operation, and multi-stakeholder continuity are intended.

## What AECRETEC Will Do

- Provide long-term proof of existence and identity for creative works and knowledge.  
- Separate content from rights, history, and distribution wrappers.  
- Enable ownership and distribution without relying on closed DRM.  
- Require proof and deterrence for content that exits the network (external distribution).  
- Provide a mechanism to reintegrate “bare” or redistributed copies into legitimate distribution via re-wrapping.  
- Treat individuals, bookstores, museums, and public institutions as peers in participation.

---

## What AECRETEC Will Not Do

- Conduct centralized arbitrary censorship.  
- Require proprietary client-side DRM as a condition of ownership.  
- Evaluate or rank the artistic or ideological worth of works.  
- Use “market only” logic to abandon cultural artifacts.  
- Execute opaque governance decisions without public process.

---

## Governance Principles

- An initial operating entity may exist, but permanent control is not intended.  
- Major changes require published debate and consensus-building.  
- The charter must remain versioned and continuously updatable without breaking continuity.

---

## Closing

AECRETEC is not aimed at completion; it aims for inheritance — to be carried forward, reinterpreted, and reimplemented.

This charter marks the non-negotiable line for future implementations.
