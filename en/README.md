AECRETEC — preserving creations, empowering creators.  
AECRETEC supports the expression, existence, freedom and rights of all creative works and everyone who engages with creation.

## About / Name origin

**AECRETEC** is intentionally expandable as a phrase. One illustrative expansion is:  
`AECRETEC — Enables Creative Realizations, Empowering Technology for Everyone's Creations.`

This phrase serves as an explanatory origin; the project places greater emphasis on the design principles than on any single wording. A playful recursive-acronym style is intended, but for readability the top-level README stays concise. See `en/CHARTER.md` for details.
